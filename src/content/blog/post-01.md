    paraOne: 'The state of software development in Bhutan is in a weird place. It feels like the country is evolving and its need for software is evolving and yet the industry itself feels stale. The software industry in Bhutan is fairly new, but in the field of technology everything evolves rapidly but it seems that the industry is failing to evolve with it. If we talk about the global industry, there was the dot-com bubble in the 90’s and early 2000’s which gave us companies like Amazon and Google. Then there was, what I like to call the Iphone revolution in the early 2010’s  which gave birth to the apps industry. Then came the crypto or web3 craze in the 2020’s along with the Metaverse which didn’t pan out great. Now we have the AI Take over.',
    paraTwo: 'It feels like the bhutanese industry falls behind each time, now I’m not saying that the industry needs to be on top of each hype train, but if you are gonna get on it, be at it when it’s at its peak, not five years later when the global market has crashed. It feels like Bhutan is wasting its resources on the wrong thing at the wrong time. Bhutan should not have an attitude like ‘we’re a small country, we can’t compete with the global market’, instead we should compete because we are small.',

    paraThree: 'Now let’s talk about the technologies used in software development. I feel like the Bhutanese Engineers and developers  have an attitude of “This is what I learned in college, this is what I’ll use”. Although I empathize with the concept, that the end user doesn’t care what technology we use to build the software. That doesn’t mean that we should stop evolving and improving. There will come a time when the tools used today will no longer serve the needs of the user, by then the ship to improve will have sailed and you will be replaced.',

    paraFour: 'You can feel the difference in performance when you visit an old government site in Bhutan and then visit an international site. We all have the same tools at our disposal. There is absolutely no reason that we cannot produce a product at that level.  We should not just strive to complete the job, we should strive to make it better than anything that has come before.',
