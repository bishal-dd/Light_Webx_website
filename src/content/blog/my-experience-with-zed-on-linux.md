      ' When I first started my development journey, I used to code on plain old Notepad. After that, I used Notepad++ a few times. Then, when I was getting into Python development, I used PyCharm for about a year. I switched to Visual Studio Code when I started with JavaScript. I also used RubyMine for a few months and tried to configure Neovim but failed miserably. For the past couple of years, VS Code has been my go-to code editor, but it seems like there is a new player in town.
      ',
    paraTwo: 'About a year ago, there was a lot of talk about a new code editor that was blazing fast and written in Rust. I wanted to try it out, but it was only available on Mac, and I used Ubuntu. Well, about two weeks ago, they released Zed for Linux, and I tried it out. Here is my review.',
    title: '',
    paraThree:
      'First of all, Zed is fast, which is to be expected. From the startup time to the file manager and even the speed of the language server, everything is exceptional. It looks really clean and smooth as well. The settings file configuration is really nice and easy to use. There is also a collaboration feature that I am never going to use. As good as Zed is and as much as I liked working with it, it is still missing a lot of features for my workflow.
      ',
    titleTwo: '',
    paraFour:
      'The biggest thing that Zed is missing for me is a Git GUI. I have been using the VS Code Git GUI for some years now, and I really canâ€™t work without it. Sometimes, I make changes to hundreds of files, and I need an easier way than the CLI to organize them. I also use Codeium for my auto-complete, and Zed only supports GitHub Copilot for now. The fuzzy file finder is also better on VS Code because it gives results on each keystroke. I am not a huge fan of the AI chatbot in the editor.
      ',
    paraFive:
      'If Zed can improve on these features, I would love to switch and would be very happy to do so. I feel like there is no editor in the space that provides the right amount of features along with performance, and Zed has great potential to fill that gap.
