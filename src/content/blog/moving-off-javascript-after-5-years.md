      " I have been using JavaScript for 5 years now. When I first started learning to code, it was the first language I learned, and I really enjoyed it. I think what attracts you to it is the ease of diving into the ecosystem; you can build websites (React, Vue, etc.), web servers (NodeJS), mobile apps (React Native), and desktop apps (Electron) with JavaScript. You can learn it quickly and start building. That's the beauty of it, but after 5 years, maybe building everything with it is a bad idea.
      ",
    paraTwo:
      'I have decided to move away from JavaScript, at least on the server side. NodeJS is great for developer velocity, which was one of the main reasons it took off in the first place—you didn’t have to learn a whole new language for the server. NodeJS is great for small applications and prototyping, but as the application grows, I feel like it does more harm than good. Don’t get me wrong, every large codebase is a mess, but with JavaScript and all its quirks and different ways of doing things, maintaining and changing the code becomes a nightmare. As the complexity of the web increases, I feel like performance is going to be a major factor in the future. Although new JS runtimes keep coming out every week that are faster than NodeJS, I don’t think it can compete with other languages.

      'So, after deciding to move off JavaScript, I had to pick a new language. There are many new players in the game, but the most promising one for me is Golang. The runtime for Go is one of the fastest, and the performance gains are significant. One of the things I like most about it is that, unlike JavaScript, the syntax and flow are very intuitive. If two people solve a problem in Go, it will probably look the same. That is why it is great for multiple team members to work on. I feel like it is hard to write bugs in Go because the error handling is very verbose, unlike the try/catch hell in JS. I see people complain that you can’t move as fast in Go, which was true in the beginning for me, but as you get the hang of it, I think you can move just as fast in Go, if not faster than JavaScript. Overall, it has been great fun to work with Golang, and I will be shifting all future backend services to Golang.
